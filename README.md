# module_checkin_flutter
#ðŸ‘‹ Introduce
This is a app made with Flutter with a UI designed by myself.

The application I created was for learning Flutter, Provider (state management), and gaining new knowledge.

During the implementation process, I encountered some errors and promptly fixed them.

Finally after a while looking for a fix, I finished this application. I will try to optimize the lines of code to the best of my ability.
